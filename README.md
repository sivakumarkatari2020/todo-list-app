## My process

For implementing this todo-list first I designed it on my figma then I started writing CSS and HTML to it and them I started writing scripts. I used sortable CDN to sort list elements and I wrote many functions for each task.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sortable CDN](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/Sortable) - JS library

### Continued development

I got a break a few days because I have a problem with Drag and Drop sorting and later I found a solution to it and that is Sortable CDN.
